# Meganote-resource
A simple Angular test of using ngResource to make for more condensed and simple code.

Based on the curriculum for [Xtern Bootcamp 2016](http://bootcamp16.getfretless.com/).

## Technical Overview
* [Angular JS 1.x](https://angularjs.org/)
* [UI Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)


In development:
* [NPM](https://github.com/npm/npm) - for development dependencies
* [Bower](https://bower.io/) - for dependencies

## Getting Started
> This app uses NPM for dependency management so install
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) if necessary

The following block will clone the repo, install the project's dependencies,
and run the server on port 8000
```
git clone https://github.com/KennethofTam/meganote-resource
cd meganote-resource
